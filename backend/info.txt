Welcome to BACKEND - BOOK STORE API.

My name is Akash Kumar Singh and here I have created an API for managing the backend of Book Data in Store. Here you can pass different routes and queries to perform various tasks like Get, Post, Patch, Delete and Sorting etc. So lets get started.

Base URL => http://localhost:PORT

GET => 
        /products  => It will give you all the data which is present under the Products Collection.

        /products?sort=price_low&page=1 or price_high => Here you can get the data of that product which will be matched to the query.
                                Example=> 
                                http://localhost:8080/products?sort=price_low&page=2
                                It will give data according to price in ascending and descending order.

        /products/get/men => http://localhost:8080/products/get/men?page=2;
        it will show you data for mens and womens basend on params;

        products/get/men?page=1&sort=price_high => http://localhost:8080/products/get/men?page=1&sort=price_high;
